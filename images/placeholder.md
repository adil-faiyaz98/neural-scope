# Placeholder for Images

This file serves as a placeholder for the actual images that will be added to this directory.

To add real images:

1. Create PNG files with the names listed in the README.md
2. Replace references to these images in the IMAGES.md file if necessary
3. Remove this placeholder file once real images are added

## Image Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that clearly indicate what the image shows:

- `model_architecture.png` - Visualization of a model's architecture
- `performance_metrics.png` - Charts showing performance metrics
- `memory_usage.png` - Memory usage visualization
- etc.

## Image Sources

Images can be generated from:

1. Neural-Scope analysis and optimization runs
2. MLflow UI screenshots
3. CI/CD pipeline visualizations
4. Custom diagrams explaining Neural-Scope concepts
